# Image_filterer
This repository is an simple code to set filters to images.

My base is image_filterer.py class that I define my main filters there :)

##How to use:
To use the class you just need to initial it with an input! then use the methods:
The code below make file "a.jpg" black with and also makes it blur (normal blur not gausian) and show it in Xwindow. 
>Editor = image_filterer('a.jpg') 

>Editor.make_gray()

>Editor.make_normal_blur()

>Editor.show()

*hope you enjoy* :)
